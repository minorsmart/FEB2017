This is an example on reading data in from an online CSV file. The data is prepared and visualised using Google visualization widgets.

First the online data file is read in.


```r
pipelineDF <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minorsmart/FEB2017/master/Witek/Pipelines/database.csv")
```

Using the `dplyr` package some columns holding geo data in proper format and level of fire (no fire, ignition, explosion) are added.


```r
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
pipelineDF <- mutate(pipelineDF,
                     LatLong = paste0(Accident.Latitude,":", Accident.Longitude),
                     Fire = as.numeric(Liquid.Ignition) + as.numeric(Liquid.Explosion)
                     )
```
Finally the map is created and plotted.
